# LMM

An LMM (Large Multimodal Model) is related to but distinct from an LLM (Large Language Model):

* LLM (Large Language Model): A model primarily designed to work with text. Examples include GPT-3, GPT-4, and Claude 3's language capabilities. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.
* LMM (Large Multimodal Model): An advanced model that can process multiple types of data (text, images, audio, etc.). An LMM builds upon LLM capabilities by adding the ability to understand and interact with different types of media.

You can think of an LMM as an evolution of an LLM - it includes all the text processing capabilities of an LLM, but with expanded abilities to handle multiple types of input and output. So while not every LLM is an LMM, every LMM contains LLM-like text processing capabilities.

In practical terms, an LMM can do everything an LLM can do, plus additional multimodal tasks like describing images, understanding video content, or generating responses that combine different types of information.
