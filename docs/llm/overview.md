# Overview

LLM's (or Large Language Models) are AI's that understands an generates human language. It learns by analyzing millions of text documents, allowing it to predict and create text that sounds like something a human might write.&#x20;

LLMs utilize complex neural networks that allow them to learn intricate patterns and nuances of human communication. They operate by predicting the most statistically likely next word in a sequence, which enables them to generate coherent and contextually relevant text across a wide range of topics and writing styles.

These models have impressive capabilities that extend beyond simple text generation. They can perform complex tasks such as writing, answering questions, translating languages, generating code, and providing detailed explanations on numerous subjects. By analyzing vast amounts of text data during training, LLMs develop a deep understanding of language structure, semantic meaning, and contextual subtleties that make their responses seem remarkably human-like.
